# MaSandra Ewing Portfolio

 ## Description
 My portfolio of work showcases my skills and talents to employers. This portfolio represents core skills of flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. This portfolio will grow as I obtain future skills and add more sections for deployed applications.

 ### Tasks Completed
 ```
 * Responsive navigation bar that changes colors as screen size changes for readability.
 * When the portfolio is loaded, my name, recent photo, and links to sections about me, my developing work, and how potential employers can contact me. 
 * When a user clicks on the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
 * When a user clicks on the link to the "My Work" section, the UI scrolls to that section with titled images.
 * My first application is presented as a larger image than the other images in any screen resolution size.
 * The images of the applications have links to my deployed applications. Please note that some links have placeholders for future projects.
 * When a user resizes the page or views the site on various screens and devices, then they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
 ```
